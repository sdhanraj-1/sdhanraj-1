        <h2> Ocean Plastic </h2>
        <p> This site aims to inform and explain the pressing issue of Plastic Pollution in our Oceans. Vast amounts of trash make its way to our
            oceans from water ways. Much of this trash is plastic based which can take hundreds of years to degrade. Even worse is the plastic particulates
            that can enter marine ecosystems during the composition. Supporting the cleanup of plastic pollution from our Oceans is of the utmost importance
            for our generation.

            <h2>How garbage patches form</h2>

            <p> Marine debris is litter that ends up in oceans, seas and other large bodies of water. The most infamous of these patche is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. 
                This is not the only massive patch of plastic in the ocean. There are concentrated areas of plastics at ALL give of the world's major gyres. 
                Gyres are zones of circular ocean currents. As plastic enters the oceans (mainly through rivers), it breaks down into smalleer peices and often 
                trapped in collections. The Northern Pacific Gyre hosts the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

            <p>
                The most famous and largest of the plastic accumulation zones in our oceans occurs in the North Placific Gyre. 
                The surface pollution has been coined the <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/great-pacific-garbage-patch/">Great Pacific Garbage Patch </a>. It is one of several locations that accumulate
                vast amounts of pollution in the Oceans. These pollutants build up over time and accumulate under the surface. What we see is only a fraction of the real pollution in the Oceans.

            <p>
                TLDL (Too Long Didn't Listen): The Garbage Patches are actually not visible via sattelite imaging. The patches are mostly tiny plastics that 
                cannot be immediately seen with the naked eye. Manufactured plastics degrade over time from sunlight and storms into smaller and smaller peices. 
                Bids and fish end up consuming these plastics and bioaccumulation can result in a build up of toxic chemical. These tiny plastics aren't as easy to remove
                as skimming the surface of the water. The best way of an inidividually to help is to create less waste, reuse, recycle and do not litter. In addition
                participating in coastal cleanups can have a significant impact.

            <p>
                Microplastics have been shown to have negative effections on phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish and larger marine organisms at a population level, cellular level
                and even a molecular level. Studies of corals have shown significant tissue damage to corals that have consumed microplastics. 
                The slow decomoposition rate of plastics results in accumulation and assimilation of pollutants into the marine food chain

                projections of the plastic accumulation in the Oceans are projected to continue at rapid rate. tens of thousands of Tonnes
